Overuse of digital devices can slowly affect mental and emotional health. Constant notifications, social media pressure, and information overload can lead to stress, anxiety, and reduced attention span. When the brain is constantly stimulated, it struggles to rest, which can impact creativity and emotional stability.

This chapter explores the physical and psychological consequences of excessive screen time, including sleep disruption, eye strain, poor posture, and emotional fatigue. Understanding these effects helps readers recognize unhealthy patterns and motivates them to make positive changes in their digital habits.
